## M.Sc. Thesis – Causal Machine Learning for Survival and Quantile Treatment Effects

**Keywords:** Causal Inference, Survival Analysis, Right-Censoring, Efficient Influence Functions, Machine Learning  

Master’s thesis developed within the M.Sc. in *Stochastics and Data Science* at the University of Torino.  
The work proposes efficient, data-adaptive estimators for treatment-specific survival curves and quantile treatment effects under right-censored data, combining causal inference theory with modern machine learning methods.

**Supervisors:**  
- **Matteo Giordano** (Supervisor)  
- **Stijn Vansteelandt** (Co-supervisor)

**Main contributions:**
- Identification of causal survival and quantile treatment effects under dependent censoring  
- Cross-fitted one-step estimators based on efficient influence functions  
- Data-adaptive nuisance estimation via Super Learner ensembles  
- Theoretical guarantees (consistency, asymptotic linearity, inference)  

**Thesis:** *Efficient Estimation of Survival Curves and Quantile Treatment Effects under Right-Censored Data: a Causal Machine Learning Approach*
