## 🔹 Survival Modelling & Treatment Effects Under Censoring
A study on efficient estimation of survival curves and quantile treatment effects in the presence of right-censoring.  
Methods include IPCW, pseudo-observations, and flexible ML models.

**Repo:** [github.com/Edoishere/survival-censoring-ml](#)

---

## 🔹 Revenue Forecasting with Hybrid Models (Italdesign)
End-to-end forecasting pipeline combining sequence models (LSTM) with tree-based predictors (XGBoost), deployed and monitored in production.  
Includes feature engineering, model comparison, and automated evaluation.

**Repo:** *(private / placeholder)*

## 🔹 Geopolitical Risk Prediction
Predictive modelling of geopolitical instability using tabular, textual, and geospatial features.  
Final output includes a probabilistic risk map and explainable attributions using gradient-based methods.

**Repo:** [github.com/Edoishere/geopolitical-risk](#)

## 🔹 Reinforcement Learning for Behavioural Modelling
Small RL environment used to explore human-like decision-making patterns and parameter recovery.  
Implements Q-learning, softmax policies, and hierarchical model fitting.

**Repo:** [github.com/Edoishere/rl-behavioural-modelling](#)

---

## 🔹 Stochastic Processes Simulations
Simulation and visualisation of Markov chains, random walks, and non-Markovian extensions in 1D/2D.  
Originally developed during my BSc thesis.

**Repo:** [github.com/Edoishere/stochastic-simulations](#)
