## Protein Structure Modelling via Topological Data Analysis

**Keywords:** Topological Data Analysis, Persistent Homology, Protein Structure, Python  

This project investigates the use of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to characterize protein structures and interactions.  
By applying persistent homology to protein conformations, the work aims to identify structural patterns that are difficult to capture with traditional geometric or statistical approaches, with implications for protein function and stability prediction.

**Main contributions:**
- Extraction of topological descriptors from protein structures using persistent homology  
- Visualization and interpretation of protein topological features  
- Predictive modelling of protein interaction and stability-related properties

## Reinforcement Learning Model of Parkinson-Related Neuronal Function

**Keywords:** Reinforcement Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Dopamine Modulation, Python  

Developed a computational reinforcement learning model to study dopamine-dependent decision-making processes relevant to Parkinson’s disease.  
The model simulates neuronal dynamics and reward-based learning mechanisms to explore how dopamine depletion affects action selection and learning efficiency.

**Main contributions:**
- Neuron-level reinforcement learning simulations  
- Modelling of reward prediction and dopamine modulation  
- Analysis of network dynamics under pathological conditions
