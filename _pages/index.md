I am a Data Scientist with a background in **stochastics, statistical modelling, and machine learning**.  
My interests focus on how data-driven models can help us understand **human behaviour, decision-making, and complex systems under uncertainty** 🧠📊.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **statistics and machine learning**, especially on problems where assumptions matter and models must remain interpretable. Recently, I have been exploring methods for **causal inference**, **survival modelling**, **reinforcement learning**, and **simulation-based inference**, with applications ranging from behavioural data to forecasting problems.

I obtained my MSc in **Stochastics & Data Science** from the University of Turin and spent an exchange semester at **Ghent University**, where I deepened my interest in causal ML and modern deep learning methods.

Beyond research, I strongly believe that scientific work is enriched by curiosity, community engagement, and activities outside academia 🌍.  
I am an active volunteer with **AVIS**, the Italian National Blood Donor Association, where I currently serve as treasurer, and together with a group of friends I co-founded a local **study room** aimed at creating an open and accessible space for students ❤️📚.

In my free time, I enjoy **running** 🏃‍♂️ (you can find me on [Strava]([https://www.strava.com/](https://strava.app.link/TBUA9wbjGZb))), **playing chess** ♟️ (on [Chess.com]([https://www.chess.com/](https://www.chess.com/member/edocarroc))), and travelling.
