I am a Data Scientist with a background in **stochastics, statistical modelling, and machine learning**.  
My interests focus on how data-driven models can help us understand human behaviour, decision processes, and complex systems under uncertainty.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **statistics and ML**, especially on problems where assumptions matter and models must remain interpretable. Recently, I have been exploring methods for **causal inference**, **survival modelling**, and **simulation-based inference**, with applications ranging from behavioural data to forecasting problems.

Before joining industry, I studied **Stochastics & Data Science** at the University of Turin and spent a semester at Ghent University, where I deepened my interest in causal ML and modern deep learning methods.

Outside of work, I volunteer in local community organisations and enjoy reading about cognitive science, computational modelling, and the philosophy of statistical learning.
