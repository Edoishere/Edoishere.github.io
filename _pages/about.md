# About me

I am a Data Scientist at **Italdesign Giugiaro** and an MSc graduate in  
**Stochastics & Data Science** at the University of Turin.

My work focuses on:

- Causal machine learning  
- Survival analysis under censoring  
- Deep learning and time-series forecasting  
- Simulation-based inference  
- Explainability (XAI)  
- Behavioural data modelling
