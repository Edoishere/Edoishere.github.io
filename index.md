# Hi, I'm Edoardo 👋

I'm a **Data Scientist at Italdesign**, with an MSc in *Stochastics & Data Science*.  
My work spans machine learning, survival analysis, explainability and causal inference.

I’m especially interested in:

- Computational psychiatry & cognitive modelling  
- Reinforcement learning  
- Causal machine learning  
- Survival analysis & quantile effects  
- Simulation-based inference  
- Explainable AI and uncertainty quantification
